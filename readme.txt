Okay. Back at it. The goal is to have a completely modular system, so a saved file also includes all the data for the fields in the barcode. Users can create barcode, text, and hopefully (!) images, upon creation the settings sidebar for the item comes along for the ride. A default file on the server will be loaded with the basic Title, Barcode, and UPC. This will be the starting point. An option to start with a blank barcode will be available. Need to be able to resize barcode. Need to be able to resize page dimensions. I should make a readme.
